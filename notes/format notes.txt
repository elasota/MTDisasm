Values are stored little endian on Windows, but big endian on Macintosh.  This is VERY handy since re-exporting the same file to both formats will tend to reveal the byte swap locations in the binary data, making it way easier to determine the size of values.  However, many data types are NOT the same size on both platforms.

Files don't appear to use any kind of context-free structure, objects are just stored sequentially, which means it's impossible to parse a file without knowing the binary layout of each object type.  A common paradigm seems to be a 32-bit ID followed by a revision number, frequently followed by what look like some sort of 32-bit ID and then a size field.  However, the size field is VERY frequently misleading, or its meaning hasn't been determined yet.  Sometimes it represents the size of the entire object starting from the type ID to the next type ID, sometimes it represents the size of a specific data chunk, sometimes it's not even there.

However, components must be modular - the editor will allow you to load a project even if the modifier's extension was removed, so they are clearly separable.

The asset table from mTropolis 1.1 contains file positions for assets, but Obsidian doesn't.  Obsidian appears to have been created with a later version, maybe 1.1.1 or 1.1.2 - 2.0 was released long after Obsidian's launch.

The asset types are the same as the DataObject types - e.g. if he asset type is 0x55, then the data object will be 0x55.  All assets appear to be size-tagged.


There are 6 types of assets: PICTs, mToons, sounds, QuickTime (movies and QTVR panoramas), MIDI, color tables.  There's an additional asset type, 0x1f, which is currently unknown, and appears to be emitted whenever you place a text label object.  0x1f assets are always unnamed.  Based on some data inspection, it looks like some kind of image, so it might be a pre-rendered image of the text.

32-bit images are stored bottom-up on Windows and top-down on Mac.

Color tables are 16 bit per channel in Mac builds and 8 bit per channel in Win builds.  Looks like indexes 0 and 255 are hard-coded to black and white respectively on Windows.

Deleting unused assets will generally wipe the "Macintosh 8bit" color table from the boot stream.

Most things that are named write the name last, which is fairly handy for locating the next object.  Unfortunately, most things that are "Unnamed" in the mTropolis editor have blank names, leading to zeroes in the data that may be mis-parsed if they contain data.

Rectangles on Mac are top, left, bottom, right
Rectangles on Win are left, top, right, bottom
Due to endian differences, this can make rectangles appear to be a pair of 32-bit integers from byte swaps.


Compressed AIFFs are nominally supported but seem to be very buggy.  Attempting to write A-Law or u-Law files fails and IMA 4:1 writes as uncompressed.

The purpose of stream terminators appears to be that some asset data is concatenated linearly at the end of the stream, outside of any object.  QuickTime movies and MIDI modifiers are still inline for some reason.  The stream terminator appears when an asset type (e.g. mToon, audio) is in the asset data section.
